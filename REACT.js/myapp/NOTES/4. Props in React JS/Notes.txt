#What is "Props"?
>React is a component-based library which divides the UI
into little reusable pieces.

>In some cases, those components need to communicate(send data to each other)
and the way to pass data between components is by using props.

>"Props" is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is 
being used for passing data from one component to another.

>But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a 
uni-directional flow.(one way from parent to child)
